# ecs_deployment_using_cloudformation_template


#bitbucket-pipelines.yml

The Bitbucket Pipelines configuration file that sets up a deployment process for a CloudFormation stack using AWS CLI and Docker. Here are the main steps of the deployment process:

Set up a Docker service to build and push the Docker image to ECR.
Configure AWS CLI with access keys and region.
Get the login password for ECR and log in to ECR using Docker.
Build the Docker image, tag it with the specified ECR image URL, and push it to ECR.
Validate the CloudFormation template using AWS CLI.
Deploy the CloudFormation stack by creating or updating it with the specified template file and the CAPABILITY_IAM capability.
Overall, this configuration file automates the process of building and deploying a Dockerized application on AWS Fargate using CloudFormation.


#ecsfargate.yaml
That cloudformation template creates a VPC and associated resources for an Amazon ECS Fargate cluster. The script defines a VPC with two public subnets in different availability zones, an internet gateway, a route table, and two route table associations. The script also creates an IAM role for the ECS task execution, a security group for the load balancer, an ECS cluster, an Elastic Load Balancer, a listener for port 80, and a default target group.

The Elastic Load Balancer is associated with the two public subnets in the VPC and a security group. The default target group is associated with the load balancer listener and will route incoming traffic to the appropriate ECS service.

Overall, this script provides the infrastructure necessary for a scalable and highly available ECS Fargate cluster.
